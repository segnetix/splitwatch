				Splitwatch
			</h1>
			<!-- Page Summary -->
			<p>
				Splitwatch is a utility designed to give you an 
				automatic calculation of rolled up splits as you 
				are timing.  That is, for say 200m intervals, Splitwatch 
				will give you each 200, 400, 800, and 1600 (or 1000m 
				if in Kilo mode) split for quick comparison/analysis 
				of various parts of a race.  Splitwatch is designed 
				especially for Track and Swimming training and competition but is 
				also effective for any event where split interval 
				recording is needed.

			<h2>
			Lap Distance Indicator
			</h2>
			<p>
			Indicates the current lap distance setting.  Each time 
			you press the lap button the Splitwatch will record a 
			lap of that distance.  Distances can be either metric 
			or English units with intervals of 25, 50, 100, 200, 
			or 400 meters or 25, 50, 110, 220, 440 yards (see 
			Settings: Split Units for more info).
			</p>
			<h2>
			Lap Count
			</h2>
			<p>
			Indicates the number of completed laps.
			</p>
			<h2>
			Current Lap Time
			</h2>
			<p>
			Keeps track of the time for the current lap.  The lap
			time is frozen for 5 seconds each time the lap button
			is hit.  After that it resumes tracking the current
			lap time.
			</p>
			<h2>
			Main Clock
			</h2>
			<p>
			Keeps the running time from start to stop, up to 99:59:59.99
			(that is 4 days 3 hours 59 minutes 59.99 seconds).
			</p>
			<h2>
			Start/Stop Button
			</h2>
			<p>
			Starts the Splitwatch and changes to a Stop button.  Time will
			continue to be tracked if you move to other parts of the interface,
			quit the application or even power down your iPhone/iPod Touch,
			until the Stop button is hit.
			</p>
			<h2>
			Lap/Reset Button
			</h2>
			<p>
			Records a lap event each time the Lap button is hit while the
			Splitwatch is running.  Note that if the Lap Disable control
			is on (see Settings: Lap Disable Control), the Lap button will
			be disabled for 2 seconds to prevent accidentally hitting the
			Lap button more than once per lap.  Turn the Lap Disable control
			off to have the Lap button enabled immediately.  The Lap button
			changes to the Reset button after the Splitwatch is stopped.

			<h2>
			Split Column Header
			</h2>
			<p>
			Indicates the current split columns.  This column header will
			change with the split unit setting (see Settings: Split Units).
			</p>
			<h2>
			Split Detail View
			</h2>
			<p>
			Each interval will be represented as a row with appropriate splits
			rolled up to the right.  While running the split detail view will
			automatically scroll as needed.  After the Splitwatch is stopped
			the split detail view can be scrolled manually to review all the
			splits.
