            <b>Event Selectors:</b>  There are four event selectors: Athlete, Event, Date and Distance which
            act as filters for your report.  The report generator initially sets the selectors to the single event
            you selected in the Split Detail view.  However, you can include more events in the report by
            selecting any or all of the selectors and setting them to the 'All' option which will not exclude
            any events based on that selector.  Once you have set the filters then tap either the Email button
            or the Print button (the Email view is detailed below).

			The subject line can be edited before sending.
